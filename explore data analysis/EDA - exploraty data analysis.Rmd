## Lesson 1: Why EDA

One of Facebook's tools, Presto,(mainly used for adhoc analysis), processes over 1 petabyte of data per day.

### Install R

Install RStudio on a Mac

Download and install the R programming language FIRST at http://cran.rstudio.com.

After you install R, you can download and install RStudio from http://www.rstudio.com.

We recommend anyone new to R and RStudio to try Swirl (statistics with interactive R learning). Swirl is a software package for the R statistical programming language. Its purpose is to teach statistics and R commands interactively.

Type the following commands in the Console, pressing Enter or Return after each line:


install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
swirl()


The str() and summary() functions are helpful commands when working with a new data set.
The str() function gives us the variable names and their types.
The summary() function gives us an idea of the values a variable can take on.

Note: You may be familiar with the || operator in Java. R uses one single & for the logical operator AND. It also uses one | for the logical operator OR.

### R function

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
subset(mtcars,wt * 1000 < 2000)
```
You can also create new variables in a data frame.

```{r}
mtcars$year <- 1974
```

To drop a variable, subset the data frame and select the variable you want to drop with a negative sign in front of it.

```{r}
mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)
```

```{r}
mtcars$wt

cond <- mtcars$wt < 3

cond

mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')

mtcars$weight_class

cond <- mtcars$wt > 3.5

mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)

mtcars$weight_class

```

## read and subset data

```{r}
getwd()
setwd('/Users/Simon/R_workspace/')

stateInfo <- read.csv('stateData.csv')
stateSubset <- subset(stateInfo,state.region == 1)
head(stateSubset,2)
dim(stateSubset)
```
subset[ROWS,COLUMNS]

```{r}
stateSubsetBracket <- stateInfo[stateInfo$state.region == 1,]
head(stateSubsetBracket,2)
dim(stateSubsetBracket)
```

```{r}
reddit <- read.csv('reddit.csv')

```
```{r}
qplot(data = reddit, x = age.range)
```
```{r}
qplot(data = reddit, x = income.range)
```



# setting levels of Ordered Factors Solution

```{r}
reddit$age.range <- ordered(reddit$age.range,levels = c('under 18','18-24','25-34','35-44','45-54','55-64','65 or above'))
```


Alternate Solution
```{r}
reddit$age.range = factor(reddit$age.range,levels = c('under 18','18-24','25-34','35-44','45-54','55-64','65 or above'), ordered = T)
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
